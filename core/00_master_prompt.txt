A hyper-detailed, photorealistic, and culturally accurate wide-shot scene of a traditional Punjabi village well. The well is old brick, surrounded by very dense, gnarled mulberry trees (toot). The time is golden hour afternoon. In the foreground, two young men, KRISHNA and SULTAN, are talking. Krishna is standing with a hopeful posture, Sultan is sitting with a worried posture. Add subtle ambient details like a bullock cart trail and a few small birds. The lighting must be cinematic and warm.
